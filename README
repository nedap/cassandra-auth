Authentication and authorization provider for Cassandra

This project implements an IAuthenticator and IAuthority2 interface
usable for Cassandra authentication. It stores the credentials in
Cassandra itself, using the following column family definitions:

create keyspace access;

create column family users with comparator = UTF8Type and
                                key_validation_class = UTF8Type and
                                default_validation_class = UTF8Type;

create column family permissions with comparator = UTF8Type and
                                      key_validation_class = UTF8Type and
                                      default_validation_class = LongType;

set users['admin']['password'] = '65536:256:b987965bf13ae010:7bc9e5e6f76e8a1424d9a44c9f5648e7b58da35a315b46049bbca360b3609d78';
set permissions['admin']['/cassandra/keyspaces'] = 8791798056959;

The passwords can be generated by building the jar file. This can be done
by executing mvn package. After this you can run the password generator:

java -jar target/cassandra-auth-1.0.jar

When entering the password it will output the entry for that password that
needs to be stored.

The permissions is a long which is composed of two 32 bit masks, one for
the grant rights and one for the access rights. The bitmask shown here
grants all the access to this user (Permission.ALL).
